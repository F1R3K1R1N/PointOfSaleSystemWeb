## 1. Learning Objectives Achieved

Through this lab, I was able to:

- Install and configure Git on different operating systems
- Initialize local repositories and link them to remote repositories on GitHub
- Use essential Git commands to track changes, stage, and commit code
- Create, switch, and merge branches to simulate feature and production workflows
- Resolve merge conflicts using both command-line tools and GitHub's interface
- Collaborate across two GitHub accounts (Team Lead and Team Member) to simulate real-world team interactions
- Understand and apply branching strategies including feature/staging/production flow
- Execute fast-forward and three-way merge operations

## 2. Lab Workflow Summary

1. Downloaded and reviewed the lab guide: `Lab_Module_2.pdf`
2. Extracted and used the starter files from `resources_Module_2.zip`
3. Created two separate GitHub accounts to simulate a team environment:
   - One acting as the **Team Lead**
   - The other as a **Team Member**
4. Performed collaborative tasks including:
   - Forking and cloning repositories
   - Adding contributors and pushing/pulling changes
   - Creating and merging feature branches
   - Simulating deployment to production via a structured branching workflow
   - Handling merge conflicts using both CLI and GitHub UI tools

## 3. Files & Structure

- `Lab_Module_2.pdf` Full lab instructions (available for reference)
- `resources_Module_2.zip` Contains all starter files
- This repository reflects the working state of the project after completing all lab tasks

## 4. ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

This lab provided hands-on experience with version control practices commonly used in collaborative development environments. Simulating a team workflow helped reinforce:

- The importance of clear commit history and branch organization
- Practical skills in resolving code conflicts
- A structured approach to code deployment using Git branching strategies

These skills are directly transferable to real-world development projects and team collaboration settings.
